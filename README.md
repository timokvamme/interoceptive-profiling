## Overview

In 833 adults, we identified three interoceptive profiles based on self-reported interoceptive accuracy (IAS) and attention (IATS) using k-means clustering, and examined their associations with mental health outcomes. Structural equation modeling revealed a dual-pathway dissociation: alexithymia follows an additive deficit model, whereas somatic symptoms follow a multiplicative amplification model in which elevated attention weakens accuracy's protective effect.

### Three interoceptive profiles

- **Efficient** (n = 302, 36%): high accuracy, low attention — lowest psychopathology across all domains
- **Hypervigilant** (n = 273, 33%): moderate accuracy, high attention — highest somatic symptoms and pain catastrophizing
- **Uncertain** (n = 258, 31%): low accuracy, moderate attention — highest alexithymia

### Key findings

- Profile membership explained 6–15% of variance in mental health outcomes (all P < 0.001)
- The alexithymia pathway showed purely additive IAS and IATS effects (no interaction, P = 0.80)
- The somatic pathway showed a significant IAS x IATS interaction (P = 0.004), where accuracy was protective only at high attention levels
- A minimal 2-item subset matched the predictive performance of the full 42-item battery

## Running the analyses

Scripts are numbered in execution order. All scripts assume the dataset (`dfc_interoception_profiling.csv`) is located in the project root (`C:/code/projects/interoceptive-profiling/`).

**Requirements:** R (4.4.0+) with `lavaan`, `glmnet`, `randomForest`, `igraph`, `tidyLPA`, `ggplot2`, `gridExtra`; Python (3.10+) with `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.

To run the full pipeline:

```bash
python scripts/run_analysis.py
```

Or run individual scripts:

```bash
Rscript scripts/04_cluster_analysis.R
Rscript scripts/12_sem_pathway_analysis.R
```
